# Windows-10-Cortana-Calculator-Application
desktop calculator for calculating basic arithmetics
I developed this calculator just like the windows 10 cortana
Calculator using WPF. I created the UI of the application
With XAML took me sometime but it was fun doing added the textboxes and
The buttons named the every of the control used so I can access them in the code behind.
And then added the funtionalities in the back end to perform the operations is to perform as a calculator.
Keep on.
